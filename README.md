# Ihu
The Ihu repository contains the codebase that runs on the raspberry-side of Project Ihu.

## Getting started
This code was tested on the Raspbian Buster OS in a virtual machine but would probably work just fine with the Raspberry Pi 4/3/2 running on a similar Raspbian OS. If you using a Raspberry Pi to run, I would recommend at least a class 10, 16GB SD card to go with it.If you are running from a virtual machine you may want to allocate at least 32GB storage, 2GB RAM and 64MB video memory for this to work properly.

### Software Requirements
1. [Raspbian OS For Desktop (Click to download the latest release)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-desktop/).
2. Open CV
3. Face_recognition Library
4. VirtualBox, if you would be running a virtual machine. [Click here to download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

### Setup Steps.
Here are some useful url's to help guide you in installing some of the software requirements for this program.

1. [Installing Raspbian OS for Desktop in Virtual Box](https://roboticsbackend.com/install-raspbian-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-virtualbox/)
2. [Installing OpenCV on the Raspberry Pi](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-opencv/)
3. [Installing dlib and face_recognition library on Raspberry Pi](https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/1ac8dbe8572f3f533df6269dab35df65#steps)

Once you have all the necessary requirements setup, run the program on any python editor and see it work like a spark.'PS: ensure a webcam is connected'
Cheers!
